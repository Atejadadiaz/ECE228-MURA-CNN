# ECE228-MURA-CNN

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect musculoskeletal abnormalities in X-ray images using the MURA dataset. It is part of the final project for the ECE 228 Machine Learning course at UCSD.

## Objective

Develop a CNN to detect musculoskeletal abnormalities in X-rays using the MURA dataset.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Scripts or instructions to obtain and preprocess the MURA dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model evaluation.
- `results/`: Output results, including trained models and evaluation metrics.
- `src/`: Source code for model architectures, training routines, and utilities.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions

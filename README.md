# ECE228-MURA-CNN

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect musculoskeletal abnormalities in X-ray images using the MURA dataset. It is part of the final project for the ECE 228 Machine Learning course at UCSD.

## Objective

Develop a CNN to detect musculoskeletal abnormalities in X-rays using the MURA dataset.

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Instructions to access the MURA dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all code and results.
- `results/`: Saved model weights and figures.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions
